<h2>1. Comparing Rhetorical Agendas of Brazilian Foreign Policymakers</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to carry out a long-term empirical analysis to discover and to compare the rhetorical agenda of the main actors involved with the outcomes of the Brazilian Foreign Policy. In this regard, my doctoral thesis and my masterâ€™s dissertation are both part and parcel of this undertaking. In the latter, I evaluated the historical construction behind the narrative and the use of the concepts of Latin America and South America in Brazilian diplomacy from 1995 to 2014. Now, in my thesis research, I am comparing thematic emphases of Brazilian Presidents and Chancellors in order to discover whether they managed to prioritize equivalent themes.</p>
